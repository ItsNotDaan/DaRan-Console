# DaRan-Console

This is a project that I and a other student have to do for our exams. 

It will be a Console with at least two controllers and one hub. 

The controllers and the hub have to be connected through wireless communications.


# The following parts are used:

## Hub:

16x16 DOT Display

16x2 LCD

Adressable leds

Buzzer

Three buttons

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)

PT100 (Temperature sensor)

nRF24L01 tranceiver

5V and 10V powerbank

Arduino ATMega2560


## Controller:

Button

Vibration motor

Buzzer

3.7V Li-Po

ATMega328P

# The following games are made:

## Finished:

Fastest Presser.

## Not finished:

Roll the dice.

Press till you die. 

# Information about the code:
The code in this project is completely written in Arduino (.ino). 

It is possible to write it in C but programming in Arduino was faster and simpler for us. 

Bootloading and uploading to the ATMega328P is also fast and easy so a little bug is fixed in 5 minutes.
